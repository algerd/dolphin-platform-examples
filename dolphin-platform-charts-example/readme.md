The Maven projects contains 3 modules: 

* The __common__ module that contains the model taht is shared between client and server
* The __server__ module that contains the Spring Boot Application and a first Dolphin Platform controller 
* The __client__ module a JavaFX application that creates a view that is bound to the Dolphin Platform controller in the server module


## How to use it
The project is created as a Maven project. You can directly import it in any IDE that supports Maven (like Eclipse, Netbeans or IntelliJ).
If you want to start the application you need to start the __ServerApplication__ class in the server module and than the __ClientApplication__ class in the client module. The client can be started several times.

If you want to start the application from commandline without IDE support you need to call a Maven install first in the main project folder:

```
mvn install
```

Once this is done you can simply install the server from the server folder
```
cd server
mvn spring-boot:run
```

A client instance can be started by Maven, too:
```
cd client
mvn exec:java
```
